    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p class="text">
      I am an A.I. Systems Failure Analysis Engineer at ZT Systems. I graduated 
      from the University of Michigan in April 2023 with
      a bachelor's in computer science. Ever since I can remember technology has
      always fascinated me. I think my earliest interaction with computer
      science was an early robotics course in maybe third grade where we used
      these coding blocks to program a Lego robot. Those things were cool and I
      wanted to buy one for my own. However, it wasn't until a career
      fair in middle school, that a software engineer from Google came by and
      explained how he'd help implement the biography feature that appears when
      you search for someone famous on Google. This blew my mind as everyone uses
      this amazing feature, but does not realize how useful it truly is. Now
      every time I look up a movie or celebrity I think of this moment where
      someone nobody knows made something that changed everyone's lives. After
      that, I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I laid out a basic plan.

      I rigorously studied the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT
      for short) to get into arguably the best high school in New York, and
      thanks to the preparation Bronx Science gave me, I managed to get accepted
      to the University of Michigan. All the while, I was only able to take
      maybe 2 classes in middle school and high school combined which taught me
      the basics of Python and coding in general. In order to get a bit more
      familiar with code, I decided to take a research opportunity at the City
      College of New York (CCNY) in association with the National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This experience fine-tuned some of my
      coding skills and gave me experience doing hands-on research which I
      presented at a symposium. Using some Python and GIS along with an air
      pollution sensor, we were able to collect air quality in Times Square and
      the World Trade Center, though we did unofficially check near the CCNY
      campus. By collecting the air quality data at various places and at
      various times, we were able to come to multiple conclusions including a
      general trend towards higher concentration of air pollution until the
      evening. Unofficial findings made us speculate that factors of economic
      quality of the areas we tested had a lot to do with the air quality as the
      poorer nearby Harlem area of CCNY had higher air pollution levels than its
      more wealthy counterparts like Times Square. Since the program lasted
      only the duration of one summer, we did not have time to explore this
      possibility further but, it was an intriguing and amazing
      experience I am glad to have been a part of.

      I was so intrigued with research that I decided to participate in yet
      another research opportunity as a freshman at U of M. This time I was in
      charge of transferring countless logs of college sports financial data
      from various college teams. At the end of the research which may be
      accumulated to about 80 hours of research, our research team developed an
      elaborate database providing an impressive resource for college sports
      finance research. During my symposium, I was able to present some
      interesting findings including revenue disparities between men and
      women's teams which seemed to correlate with funding disparities in both
      teams received. Ultimately, while nothing concrete could be asserted from
      a surface-level investigation, the database provided a phenomenal resource
      for not just answering some questions, but discovering new questions that
      are worth addressing. During my final semester, I truly honed my skills in my
      most demanding and productive courses and the product of my work can
      be found in the projects section of this website.

      I focused on my passion of data analysis during these classes which I applied
      at my job as an A.I. Systems Failure Analysis Engineer at ZT Systems. Here, I 
      lead all data-related tasks department-wide and problems. I have helped build,
      diagnose, and debug servers for shipment while simultaneously teaching other 
      technicians how to best fix servers both in factories and at various data 
      centers. I have also maintained and worked on a plethora of server designs.
      I invoke my expertise in Python and Excel to create custom and novel solutions
      to tricky problems and help create reports on project health. I also develop 
      key tools to interact and properly extract data from huge databases to better 
      display and understand data. My job in Failure Analysis does not often
      require my data analysis expertise, but as it is my passion I have sought 
      out incorporating it as much as possible, to not only grow my skills but to 
      make our team as efficient as possible. I hope to continue to perfect my data
      analysis abilities to discover more insight into data and do so with more 
      detail and speed. Below you can find my resume, contact information, 
      and a link to my LinkedIn page.
