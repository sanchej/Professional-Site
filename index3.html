    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p class="text">
      I am a senior at the University of Michigan graduating in April 2023 with
      a bachelor's in computer science. Ever since I can remember technology has
      always fascinated me. I think my earliest interaction with computer
      science is an early robotics course in maybe third grade where we used
      these coding blocks to program a lego robot. Those things were cool and I
      really wanted to buy one for my own. However, it wasn't until a career
      fair in middle school, where a software engineer from Google came by and
      explained how he'd help implement the biography feature that appears when
      you search someone famous on Google. This blew my mind as everyone uses
      this amazing feature, but do not realize how useful it truly is. Now
      everytime I look up the a movie or celebrity I think of this moment where
      someone nobody knows made something that changed everyone's lives. After
      that, I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I laid out a basic plan.

      I rigorously studied the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT
      for short) to get into arguably the best highschool in New York, and
      thanks to the preparation Bronx Science gave me, I managed to get accepted
      to the University of Michigan. All the while, I was only able to take
      maybe 2 classes in middle school and high school combined which taught me
      the basics of python and coding in general. In order to get a bit more
      familiar with code, I decided to take a research opportunity at the City
      College of New York (CCNY) in association with the National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This experience fine tuned some of my
      coding skills and gave me experience doing hands on research which I
      presented at a symposium. Using some python and GIS along with an air
      pollution sensor, we were able to collect air quality in Times Square and
      the World Trade Center, though we did unofficially check near the CCNY
      campus. By collecting the air quality data at various places and at
      various times, we were able to come to multiple conclusions including a
      general trend towards higher concentration of air pollution until the
      evening. Unofficial findings made us speculate that factors of economic
      quality of the areas we tested had a lot to do with the air quality as the
      poorer nearby Harlem area of CCNY had higher air pollution levels then its
      more wealthy counter parts like Times Square. Since the program lasted
      only the duration of one summer, we did not have time to explore this
      possibility further but nonetheless, it was an intriguing and amazing
      experience I am glad to have been apart of.

      I was so intrigued with research that I decided to participate in yet
      another research opportunity as a freshman at U of M. This time I was in
      charge of transferring countless logs of college sports financial data
      from various college teams. At the end of the research which maybe
      accumulated to about 80 hours of research, our research team developed an
      elaborate database providing an impressive resource for college sports
      finance research. During my symposium, I was able to present some
      interesting findings including revenue disparities between men's and
      women's teams which seemed to correlate with funding disparities both
      teams received. Ultimately, while nothing concrete could be asserted from
      a surface level investigation, the database provided a phenomenal resource
      for not just answering some questions, but discovering new questions that
      are worth addressing. Since the end of my research I have been focused on
      my studies which most recently landed me on the Dean's Honor list during
      the Winter 2022 semester, and I am steady on my way to graduating and
      joining the job force. This semester I have truly honed in my skills in my
      most demanding and productive courses yet and the product of my work can
      be found in the projects section of this website. Below you can find my
      resume, my contact information and a link to my LinkedIn page.
